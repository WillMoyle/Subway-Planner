This program was developed by Will Moyle as part of his MSc Degree in Computing Science from Imperial College, London

The program makes use of some pre-supplied text files and functions (written by the academic staff at the university). All code written not by Will Moyle is clearly indicated

The program allows for navigation about an underground subway map that is given as an ASCII text file contained in the 'Data' folder.
